# Elevator Exercise

## Plan an elevator system according to the following requirements:

1.	The building has 10 foors (including ground foor) and 5 elevators.

2.	Near each foor, present a green button to call an elevator

## Calling an elevator

3.	Change the “call” button to red, and change the text to “waiting”

4.	Identify the closet elevator to the foor, and send the elevator to that foor

 - There's a chance all the elevators will be occupied at that moment

 - Do not miss any calls (queue?)

5.	The elevator should move toward the select foor in a smooth movement

6.	Measure the time it took the elevator to reach the designated foor

7.	Change the elevator color to red


## Elevator reached the floor

8.	Make a sound when the elevator reaches the foor

9.	Change the elevator color to green

10.	Wait 2 seconds before moving to the next call (If exists)

11.	Change the button text to “arrived” and the design according to the design below

12.	After the 2 seconds, change the elevator color back to black, and change the button to “call”, with the initial design

## Technical

13.	Create a clear design infrastructure (CSS/SCSS))

14.	Create an entry point to the application, for your choosing

15.	Try to follow the design as much as possible

16.	Elevator SVG fle can be found here

 

## Conclusion

- The purpose of the exrc is to test the infrastructure and the design of your code, but we the solution should also work as expected
- Please use one of the following frameworks
-- Vanilla (Native JS)
-- Jquery
- No need to build the HTML in JS (example elem.createElement(‘div’)) permission)


# Good Luck
